# SPI_slave_with_single_port_sync_RAM
 This project implements an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) slave module designed to communicate with the master. The slave utilizes a single-port synchronous RAM with an active-low reset, offering a memory depth of 256 and an 8-bit address size by default. This configuration allows efficient data storage and retrieval during SPI transactions.

## Design Specifications
### SPI Module
MOSI (Master Out Slave In): Receives data from the SPI master.
SS_n (Slave Select): Active-low signal enabling SPI communication.
MISO (Master In Slave Out): Sends data to the SPI master.
rx_data (10-bit): Data received from the master, consisting of address and data bits.
tx_data (8-bit): Data sent from the RAM to the SPI master.
### FSM States:
IDLE
CHK_CMD (Check Command)
WRITE (Write to RAM)
READ_ADD (Read Address from RAM)
READ_DATA (Read Data from RAM)
The FSM handles SPI transactions and controls whether to write data to or read data from RAM.
### RAM Module
MEM_DEPTH: Memory depth, default set to 256 entries.

ADDR_SIZE: Address size, default set to 8 bits.

din (10-bit): Input data containing the address and data bits.

dout (8-bit): Output data sent to the SPI module.

tx_valid: Validates when data is ready to be transmitted.

rx_valid: Signals valid data reception.

The RAM module stores the received data and addresses, supporting read and write operations based on SPI commands.

### Control and Clock Signals
clk: Clock signal driving both the SPI and RAM modules.
rst_n: Active-low reset signal for both SPI and RAM modules.
## Operational Flow
The SPI module receives data via MOSI from the SPI master, which is then decoded.
Based on the received command, the SPI module determines whether to write data to or read data from the RAM.
During a read operation, data from the RAM is transmitted back to the master via the MISO line.
The RAM block is responsible for addressing, storing, and retrieving data based on the SPI commands.

# SPI_slave_with_single_port_sync_RAM
 This project implements an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) slave module designed to communicate with the master. The slave utilizes a single-port synchronous RAM with an active-low reset, offering a memory depth of 256 and an 8-bit address size by default. This configuration allows efficient data storage and retrieval during SPI transactions.
